                <h5><i>Programme Content</i></h5>
                <p>The NPQML training programme comprises of a range of professional learning opportunities, built around 12 course modules for delivering the foundations of successful leadership. These modules cover all the key middle leadership responsibilities.
                <br><br>Participants will need to attend 6 whole day face-to-face sessions over the course of the programme to complete the modules. Each module contains a mixture of theoretical input drawing on up-to-date research and evidence, structured reflection, peer discussion and ideas for practical application. Between sessions there will be guided readings and tasks to complete, including contributing to an online community. Participants will also be required to undertake a school improvement project and submit a report of this, which will be formally assessed.
                <br><br>Schools sending participants will be asked to provide in-house coaching to support the professional development of participants through the programme and the completion of their school improvement project.
                <br><br>Indicative time allocations for these tasks are:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Self study intersessional tasks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 hours</li>
                <li>Online engagement with peers&nbsp;&nbsp;12 hours</li> <li>Coaching&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 hours</li>
                <li>Improvement project&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150 hours</li></ul>

                <h5><i>Final Assessment</i></h5>
                <p>In order to gain the NPQML participants are required to submit a report on their in-school improvement project, totalling 4500 words. The school improvement project normally should last at least 2 terms and must demonstrate impact on improving team capability and improving pupil progress and attainment.
                <br><br>This submission is assessed against the knowledge and skills set out in the 6 NPQML content areas: strategy and improvement, teaching & curriculum excellence, leading with impact, working in partnership, managing resources and risks, increasing capability. Participants must demonstrate competency in all areas in order to achieve the NPQML. This is in addition to the requirement to attend all face-to-face days and complete tasks between sessions.
                <br><br>Guidance and support will be given to participants on the face-to-face days regarding the school improvement project and assessment.</p>
